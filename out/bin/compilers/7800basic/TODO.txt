 Horizontal Scrolling Notes

 - uses sprites-as-tiles design
 - if the tiles aren't aligned at 16 pixel boundaries, just do the fine scroll.
 - if the tiles are aligned at 16 pixel boundaries, setup the tile greater than 159 at the correct X, depending on scroll direction, with new graphics scroll, then do the fine scroll.
